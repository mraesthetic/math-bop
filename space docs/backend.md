***Reel Intent Guidelines**

**Reel 1**
Entry Column / Low-Heavy Stabilizer
Role: safe entry into the spin; creates early structure without giving away volatility.
No Wilds allowed
Very low premium density (only occasional)
Heaviest low-symbol density (10–A) in the whole game
Scatter possible but lowest frequency
Purpose: form early 2OAKs, minimize dead starts, control volatility
Top/Mid/Bottom layout:
Top: more dead/low spaces → slows down too-early teases
Mid: main hit-band for small wins
Bottom: lows + rare mids for late-connection moments

**Reel 2**
Mid Ramp / First Volatility Bridge
Role: transitions from safety (reel 1) into the volatile core.
Wilds allowed (low density) — singles, not clusters
Moderate mids, slightly more than reel 1
Occasional premiums
Scatter low-to-medium frequency
Purpose: bridge between low-entry and the premium/Wild-heavy center
Top/Mid/Bottom layout:
Top: mix of lows/mids for light teases
Mid: blended lows/mids/premiums → healthy hit-band
Bottom: slightly increased premiums to create late-line-rescues

**Reel 3**
Role: central “tension reel,” identical to Clumsy Cowboys’ structure.
Wilds allowed (medium density) — singles + occasional close proximity
Highest premium density in the whole reelset
Scatter medium frequency
Purpose: this is the reel that creates 80% of the “potential moments,” big-line setups, and 2-scatter teases
Top/Mid/Bottom layout:
Top: frequent premium appearance → visual volatility
Mid: densest band for premiums + Wilds
Bottom: calmer to avoid delivering too often

**Reel 4**
Wild Cluster Lane / Premium Connector
Role: the big connector reel; this is where major wins come alive.
Wilds allowed (highest density in game)
Can cluster in proximity (not fully stacked)
Good premium density but less than reel 3
Scatter medium frequency
Purpose: connects reel 3 volatility with reel 5 finishers; drives big hits, near-misses, and bonus tension
Top/Mid/Bottom layout:
Top: visible Wilds + premiums → “if only it continued” moments
Mid: primary Wild cluster band
Bottom: connection band for medium wins

**Reel 5**
Finisher / Scatter Anchor (No Wilds)
Role: close lines, deliver the 3rd/4th scatter, and finish premium setups.
No Wilds allowed
Premium density medium — strong enough to complete lines, not start them
Scatter highest density in the entire game → main anchor reel
Purpose: majority of 3rd-scatter lands should happen mid/bottom here
Top/Mid/Bottom layout:
- Top: light scattering to avoid too many failed early teases
- Mid: strongest scatter band
- Bottom: second-strongest scatter band for dramatic “last-row saves”

Space Dummies is a high-volatility sci-fi comedy slot where two incompetent explorers — Chip (engineer human) and Zog (alien sidekick) — blast through space while unstable Rocket Wilds and a powerful Symbol Removal system reshape the reels during free spins. The game’s core identity mirrors the tension, pacing, and volatility curve of Clumsy Cowboys.

2. SYMBOL SET & PAYTABLE EQUIVALENTS
Wild Symbol – Rocket Wild Multiplier
Appears only on reels 2, 3, 4
Always carries a multiplier: x2, x3, x5, or x10

Used to trigger Rocket Riot (3 scatters) and Hyperdrive Havoc (4 scatters)
Base game scatters appear on reels 2–5
Bonus game scatters appear only on reels 1 and 5 
Landing both (1 & 5) during bonus = retrigger + symbol removal

3. BASE GAME RULES

Fewer premiums
Wilds moderate
Breathing area

Lows + mids
Scatter window 2
