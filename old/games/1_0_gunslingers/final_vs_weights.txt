VS MULTIPLIER WEIGHT CALCULATIONS
==================================

REGULAR BONUS:
-------------
Original: {2: 830, 3: 170, 4: 60, 5: 22, 8: 3, 10: 1}
- Total: 1086
- Weighted: 2×830 + 3×170 + 4×60 + 5×22 + 8×3 + 10×1 = 2554
- Average: 2554/1086 = 2.352...

Adding 25×:1, 50×:1:
- Need to maintain ~2.35× average

Let w2 = weight for 2×
Fixed weights: 3×: 170, 4×: 60, 5×: 22, 8×: 3, 10×: 1, 25×: 1, 50×: 1
Total fixed weight (excluding 2×): 258
Fixed weighted sum (excluding 2×): 3×170 + 4×60 + 5×22 + 8×3 + 10×1 + 25×1 + 50×1
  = 510 + 240 + 110 + 24 + 10 + 25 + 50 = 969

Total = w2 + 258
Weighted = 2×w2 + 969
Average = (2×w2 + 969) / (w2 + 258) = 2.35

Solving:
2×w2 + 969 = 2.35×(w2 + 258)
2×w2 + 969 = 2.35×w2 + 606.3
969 - 606.3 = 2.35×w2 - 2×w2
362.7 = 0.35×w2
w2 = 362.7 / 0.35 = 1036.29 ≈ 1036

But this is HIGHER than original 830, which seems wrong...

Actually, let me recalculate the original weighted sum:
2×830 = 1660
3×170 = 510
4×60 = 240
5×22 = 110
8×3 = 24
10×1 = 10
Sum = 1660 + 510 + 240 + 110 + 24 + 10 = 2554 ✓

With 25× and 50× added:
New weighted sum = 2554 + 25 + 50 = 2629
New total = 1086 + 2 = 1088
New average = 2629/1088 = 2.416... (too high)

To get to 2.35:
Needed weighted sum = 1088 × 2.35 = 2556.8
Need to reduce by = 2629 - 2556.8 = 72.2

If we reduce 2× weight by 1, weighted sum reduces by 2.
So we need to reduce 2× by: 72.2 / 2 = 36.1 ≈ 36

New 2× = 830 - 36 = 794

Verify:
2×: 794, 3×: 170, 4×: 60, 5×: 22, 8×: 3, 10×: 1, 25×: 1, 50×: 1
Total = 794 + 170 + 60 + 22 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 1052
Weighted = 2×794 + 3×170 + 4×60 + 5×22 + 8×3 + 10×1 + 25×1 + 50×1
  = 1588 + 510 + 240 + 110 + 24 + 10 + 25 + 50 = 2557
Average = 2557/1052 = 2.431... (still too high)

Need to reduce more. Try 2×: 780:
Total = 780 + 258 = 1038
Weighted = 2×780 + 969 = 1560 + 969 = 2529
Average = 2529/1038 = 2.436... (still high)

Try 2×: 770:
Total = 770 + 258 = 1028
Weighted = 2×770 + 969 = 1540 + 969 = 2509
Average = 2509/1028 = 2.441... (even higher, wrong direction!)

Wait, I'm making an error. Let me recalculate the fixed weighted sum:
3×170 = 510
4×60 = 240
5×22 = 110
8×3 = 24
10×1 = 10
25×1 = 25
50×1 = 50
Sum = 510 + 240 + 110 + 24 + 10 + 25 + 50 = 969 ✓

If 2×: 770, then:
Total = 770 + 258 = 1028
Weighted = 2×770 + 969 = 1540 + 969 = 2509
Average = 2509/1028 = 2.441...

That's still too high. The issue is that 969/258 = 3.756, which is much higher than 2.35.

I need to reduce the fixed weights too, not just 2×. Let me try reducing 3× as well:

Try: 2×: 810, 3×: 168 (reduce by 2)
Fixed: 3×: 168, 4×: 60, 5×: 22, 8×: 3, 10×: 1, 25×: 1, 50×: 1
Fixed total: 256
Fixed weighted: 3×168 + 240 + 110 + 24 + 10 + 25 + 50 = 504 + 459 = 963

Total = 810 + 256 = 1066
Weighted = 2×810 + 963 = 1620 + 963 = 2583
Average = 2583/1066 = 2.423... (still high)

Try 2×: 800, 3×: 168:
Total = 800 + 256 = 1056
Weighted = 2×800 + 963 = 1600 + 963 = 2563
Average = 2563/1056 = 2.427... (still high)

The problem is that adding 25 and 50 (which contribute 75 to weighted sum) significantly increases the average. I need to reduce 2× more aggressively.

Let me try a different approach: reduce 2× significantly and also reduce 3× a bit more.

Try: 2×: 780, 3×: 165
Fixed: 3×: 165, 4×: 60, 5×: 22, 8×: 3, 10×: 1, 25×: 1, 50×: 1
Fixed total: 252
Fixed weighted: 3×165 + 240 + 110 + 24 + 10 + 25 + 50 = 495 + 459 = 954

Total = 780 + 252 = 1032
Weighted = 2×780 + 954 = 1560 + 954 = 2514
Average = 2514/1032 = 2.436... (still high)

Let me try reducing 2× even more: 2×: 760, 3×: 165
Total = 760 + 252 = 1012
Weighted = 2×760 + 954 = 1520 + 954 = 2474
Average = 2474/1012 = 2.444... (still high, this is strange)

Wait, I think I'm calculating the fixed weighted sum wrong. Let me recalculate:
Fixed weights (excluding 2×): 3×: 165, 4×: 60, 5×: 22, 8×: 3, 10×: 1, 25×: 1, 50×: 1
Weighted contributions:
- 3×: 165 → 495
- 4×: 60 → 240
- 5×: 22 → 110
- 8×: 3 → 24
- 10×: 1 → 10
- 25×: 1 → 25
- 50×: 1 → 50
Total = 495 + 240 + 110 + 24 + 10 + 25 + 50 = 954 ✓

But 954/252 = 3.786, which is the average of the fixed weights. This is higher than 2.35, so adding more 2× (which has value 2) will bring the average DOWN, not up.

So if I have:
Total = w2 + 252
Weighted = 2×w2 + 954
Average = (2×w2 + 954) / (w2 + 252)

For average = 2.35:
2×w2 + 954 = 2.35×(w2 + 252)
2×w2 + 954 = 2.35×w2 + 592.2
954 - 592.2 = 2.35×w2 - 2×w2
361.8 = 0.35×w2
w2 = 361.8 / 0.35 = 1033.7 ≈ 1034

So with 3×: 165, we need 2×: 1034. That's higher than 830, which makes sense because we reduced 3× from 170 to 165.

But the user wants to keep 2× as the most common, and we don't want to increase it too much. Let me try a different balance:

Goal: Keep average ~2.35, add 25× and 50×, keep 2× most common but not increase it too much.

Let's try: 2×: 810, 3×: 168, keep others the same
Fixed (excluding 2×): 3×: 168, 4×: 60, 5×: 22, 8×: 3, 10×: 1, 25×: 1, 50×: 1
Fixed total: 256
Fixed weighted: 504 + 240 + 110 + 24 + 10 + 25 + 50 = 963

Total = 810 + 256 = 1066
Weighted = 2×810 + 963 = 1620 + 963 = 2583
Average = 2583/1066 = 2.423...

Still too high. I need to reduce 2× more or reduce other weights more.

Try: 2×: 800, 3×: 167
Fixed: 3×: 167, 4×: 60, 5×: 22, 8×: 3, 10×: 1, 25×: 1, 50×: 1
Fixed total: 255
Fixed weighted: 501 + 240 + 110 + 24 + 10 + 25 + 50 = 960

Total = 800 + 255 = 1055
Weighted = 2×800 + 960 = 1600 + 960 = 2560
Average = 2560/1055 = 2.427...

Still high. Let me try: 2×: 790, 3×: 167
Total = 790 + 255 = 1045
Weighted = 2×790 + 960 = 1580 + 960 = 2540
Average = 2540/1045 = 2.431...

Still high. The issue is that the fixed weights (with 25× and 50×) have a high average contribution.

Let me try reducing 3× more: 2×: 810, 3×: 165
Fixed: 3×: 165, 4×: 60, 5×: 22, 8×: 3, 10×: 1, 25×: 1, 50×: 1
Fixed total: 253
Fixed weighted: 495 + 240 + 110 + 24 + 10 + 25 + 50 = 954

Total = 810 + 253 = 1063
Weighted = 2×810 + 954 = 1620 + 954 = 2574
Average = 2574/1063 = 2.421...

Still high. I think I need to use the algebraic solution. Let me solve properly:

For regular bonus with fixed weights (excluding 2×):
Let fixed_total = sum of weights for {3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 25, 50}
Let fixed_weighted = weighted sum for those multipliers

If we use: 3×: 170, 4×: 60, 5×: 22, 8×: 3, 10×: 1, 25×: 1, 50×: 1
fixed_total = 258
fixed_weighted = 969

We want: (2×w2 + 969) / (w2 + 258) = 2.35
2×w2 + 969 = 2.35×w2 + 606.3
362.7 = 0.35×w2
w2 = 1036

So with these fixed weights, we need w2 = 1036. But this is higher than the original 830, which means we'd be increasing the weight of 2×, which goes against the goal of keeping it similar or reducing it.

The solution is to REDUCE the fixed weights, particularly 3×, so that we need a LOWER w2.

Let me try: 3×: 165 (reduce by 5), keep others
Fixed: 3×: 165, 4×: 60, 5×: 22, 8×: 3, 10×: 1, 25×: 1, 50×: 1
fixed_total = 253
fixed_weighted = 3×165 + 240 + 110 + 24 + 10 + 25 + 50 = 495 + 459 = 954

We want: (2×w2 + 954) / (w2 + 253) = 2.35
2×w2 + 954 = 2.35×w2 + 594.55
359.45 = 0.35×w2
w2 = 1027

Still higher than 830. Let me reduce 3× more: 3×: 160
Fixed: 3×: 160, 4×: 60, 5×: 22, 8×: 3, 10×: 1, 25×: 1, 50×: 1
fixed_total = 248
fixed_weighted = 480 + 459 = 939

We want: (2×w2 + 939) / (w2 + 248) = 2.35
2×w2 + 939 = 2.35×w2 + 582.8
356.2 = 0.35×w2
w2 = 1018

Still higher. Let me try: 3×: 155
fixed_total = 243
fixed_weighted = 465 + 459 = 924

We want: (2×w2 + 924) / (w2 + 243) = 2.35
2×w2 + 924 = 2.35×w2 + 571.05
352.95 = 0.35×w2
w2 = 1008

Getting closer. Let me try: 3×: 150
fixed_total = 238
fixed_weighted = 450 + 459 = 909

We want: (2×w2 + 909) / (w2 + 238) = 2.35
2×w2 + 909 = 2.35×w2 + 559.3
349.7 = 0.35×w2
w2 = 999

Still higher than 830. I think the issue is that I'm trying to keep 3× too high. But actually, maybe it's okay to have w2 higher than 830? The user said "keep 2× as most common", which it still will be even if the weight is higher.

But actually, if I increase w2 from 830 to 1036, that's a big increase. Let me think about this differently.

Maybe I should reduce other weights too, not just 3×. Let me try reducing 4× as well:

Try: 3×: 168, 4×: 58 (reduce by 2)
Fixed: 3×: 168, 4×: 58, 5×: 22, 8×: 3, 10×: 1, 25×: 1, 50×: 1
fixed_total = 254
fixed_weighted = 504 + 232 + 110 + 24 + 10 + 25 + 50 = 955

We want: (2×w2 + 955) / (w2 + 254) = 2.35
2×w2 + 955 = 2.35×w2 + 596.9
358.1 = 0.35×w2
w2 = 1023

Still high. 

I realize the core challenge is maintaining the original average while introducing new multipliers. The key is finding a balance that keeps the overall distribution consistent, even if individual weights shift. Reducing multiple weights simultaneously might help achieve the target average more effectively.

The goal is to preserve the fundamental distribution characteristics while making necessary adjustments. This might require more nuanced weight modifications across different multiplier categories.

Exploring a different strategy, I'll consider a more balanced approach to weight reduction that maintains the overall statistical integrity of the system.
