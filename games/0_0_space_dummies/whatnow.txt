What to do now
Review hit rates / RTP per mode: open library/analysis/analysis_base.csv, analysis_bonus_hunt.csv, etc. to confirm the base vs free-spin contribution matches the targets (Bonus Hunt scatters should be roughly 3× the base frequency, buys should sit near 96.2 % once weighted by their costs).
Adjust distribution quotas if needed: if, for example, Bonus Hunt only doubles the free-spin frequency, bump the Distribution(... quota=...) values in game_config.py and rerun.
Check lookup weights: optimization wrote lookUpTable_<mode>_0.csv; inspect the weighted RTP (third column × probability) to ensure each mode is balancing to 0.962. If one is off, tweak the optimization conditions or rerun with more sims.
Let me know which stats you want me to dig into first (e.g., Bonus Hunt free-spin rate, buy-mode RTP), and I’ll pull them from the generated analysis files.
